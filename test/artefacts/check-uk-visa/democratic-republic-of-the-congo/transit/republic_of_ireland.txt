You’ll need a visa to pass through the UK (unless you’re exempt)


You’ll usually need to apply for a UK [standard visitor visa](/standard-visitor-visa).

##Transiting without a visa

You might be eligible for ‘transit without visa’ if:

- you arrive and depart by air

- have a confirmed onward flight that leaves on the day you arrive or before midnight on the day after you arrive

- have the right documents for your destination (for example a visa for that country)

You must also have an Irish biometric visa (marked ‘BC’ or ‘BC BIVS’ in the ‘Remarks’ section) and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland.

E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.

All visas and residence permits must be valid.

You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules.
