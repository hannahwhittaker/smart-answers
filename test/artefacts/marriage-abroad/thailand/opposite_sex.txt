Marriage in Thailand

## Before you start

Contact the local district office (‘amphur’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to swear an affirmation that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

This costs £50 per person. You can pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/thailand-consular-fees) with cash or card.

s1. Download an [affirmation](/government/publications/information-for-british-nationals-intending-to-marry-in-thailand).
s2. Print it out but don’t sign it - you’ll need to sign it at the embassy.
s3. [Make an appointment at the embassy in Bangkok](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-bangkok/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to swear your affirmation.

^Your partner will also need to swear an affirmation if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document.^

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- your affirmation
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

If your documents were issued outside the UK or Thailand, they must be certified by the country’s embassy in Thailand. If they aren’t in English, you’ll need to bring [certified translations](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers) as well as the originals.

### Translate and legalise your affirmation

You’ll need to get your affirmation [translated](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers) into Thai and ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/16265-Naturalization-Legalization.html) in Thailand.

## Get married

You should take your affirmation to the district office where you’re getting married. The registrar will marry you and give you 2 identical marriage certificates in Thai.

You can also pay a fee for the registrar to marry you at your chosen wedding venue.

^Religious ceremonies aren’t valid on their own. The registrar must marry you.^

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Thailand
- it would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
