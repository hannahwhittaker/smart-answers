Marriage and PACS in France

## Before you start

You can either get married or enter into a PACS (‘pacte civil de solidarité’, or ‘civil solidarity pact’). PACS is the French version of civil partnership.

### Marriage

Contact the local town hall (‘mairie’) to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You, your partner or one of your parents need to have lived in the town where you want to get married for at least 40 days before the ceremony.

### PACS

Contact the local court (‘tribunal d’instance’) to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married or enter into a PACS

The town hall or court might ask you for a certificate of celibacy (‘certificat de célibat’) to prove you’re legally allowed to get married or enter into a PACS. British nationals can’t get this, so you’ll need to [download an official note](/government/publications/france-explanatory-note-in-lieu-of-certificat-celibat) instead.

You’ll also need to get a certificate of custom (‘certificat de coutume’).

Some town halls or courts only accept a certificate of custom dated less than 6 months before your wedding or PACS. You should check with them before you apply. If your certificate is refused because you applied too early, you will need to apply and pay again.

### Get a certificate of custom

s1. Download the application form for certificate of custom for [marriage](/government/publications/application-for-a-certificate-of-custom-law-for-marriage-france) or [PACS](/government/publications/application-form-for-certificate-of-custom-law-for-pacs-france).

A certificate of custom costs £50. You’ll have to pay the fee [in euros](/government/publications/france-consular-fees).

^If you both need a certificate of custom you can apply at the same time, but each partner must provide a completed application form and supporting documents. You’ll have to pay 2 fees but only one return postage fee.^

The embassy will send your certificate and documents 2 to 3 weeks after receiving your application. Certificates are issued in French and don’t need to be legalised.

## Get married or enter into a PACS

^If you’re getting married, you’ll need to have a civil ceremony before you can have a religious ceremony.^

You’ll need to give your certificate of custom and official note to the town hall or court at least 6 weeks before your wedding or PACS. You can book civil and religious ceremonies at the town hall.

## After you get married or enter into a PACS

You don’t need to register your marriage or PACS in the UK.

### If you got married

Your marriage should be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in France
- it would be allowed under UK law

### If you entered into a PACS

Opposite sex PACS isn’t recognised in the UK.

Same-sex PACS is recognised as civil partnership in the UK.

If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
