Marriage in Jordan

Contact the [Embassy of Jordan](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^There are no civil marriages in Jordan, but you can get married through a religious ceremony at a church or Sharia court.^

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Jordan](/foreign-travel-advice/jordan) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

###Islamic marriages

If you’re getting married at the Sharia Court, you’ll need to provide a single declaration document to prove you’re allowed to marry or a single divorced declaration document if you’re divorced.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Amman](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-amman/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) to get a copy of the single declaration.

You’ll need to pay a fee and bring your passport and your partner’s passport.

^Documents must be originals if you are getting married at the Sharia Court.^

###Non-Islamic marriages

For non-Islamic marriages, you’ll be asked to swear an oath before you get married. You must do this at the British Embassy in Amman.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the [affidavit form](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affidavit-of-marital-status-jordan) in advance.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Amman](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-amman/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker).

You need to bring:

- the affidavit form if you have filled it in advance
- your passport
- your partner’s passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need equivalent documents for your partner

###If you’re divorced, widowed or been previously in a civil partnership

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a decree absolute or final order
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s death certificate

You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it legalised and translated if it’s not in English.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

###If you can’t have a religious ceremony

If you can’t get married at church or Sharia Court, you may be able to get married at the British Embassy in Amman. You and your partner both need to be resident in Jordan and need to prove that there are no other suitable facilities to get married locally.

You’ll need to pay separate fees for this service.

Email <cons.amman@fco.gov.uk> for more information.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
