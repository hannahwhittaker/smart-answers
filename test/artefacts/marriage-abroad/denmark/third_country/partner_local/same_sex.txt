Civil partnership in Denmark

Same-sex relationships in Denmark that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’registreret partnerskab’ (’registered partnership’)
- ‘nalunaarsukkamik inooqatigiinneq’ (in Greenland)

Contact the relevant local authorities in Denmark to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Denmark](/foreign-travel-advice/denmark) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You need to apply for either:

- a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the British Embassy or UK registrar
- a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office

###Certificate of no impediment (CNI)

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/denmark/uk/partner_british/same_sex)
- [go to Denmark and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/denmark/ceremony_country/partner_british/same_sex)

%If you choose to post notice, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%

###No trace letters

The Danish authorities will sometimes accept a ‘no trace letter’ instead of a CNI. Check with the Danish authorities to find out if they’ll accept a ‘no trace letter’.

You can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. Ask them to make a search and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’.
