Civil partnership in Denmark

Same-sex relationships in Denmark that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’registreret partnerskab’ (’registered partnership’)
- ‘nalunaarsukkamik inooqatigiinneq’ (in Greenland)

Contact the [Embassy of Denmark](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Denmark](/foreign-travel-advice/denmark) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You need to apply for either:

- a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from the British Embassy or UK registrar
- a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office

###Certificate of no impediment (CNI)

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Denmark to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

### Legalisation and translation

You should check if your CNI needs to be:

- ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)

You should also check with the local authorities in Denmark to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

###No trace letters

The Danish authorities will sometimes accept a ‘no trace letter’ instead of a CNI. Check with the Danish authorities to find out if they’ll accept a ‘no trace letter’.

You can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. Ask them to make a search and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’.
