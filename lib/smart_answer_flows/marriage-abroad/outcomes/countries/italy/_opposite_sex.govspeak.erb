## Before you start

Contact the local Italian ‘comune’ (town hall) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

If you’re a woman and you live in Italy, you must wait 300 days after divorcing or the death of your husband before remarrying.

## Prove you’re free to get married

What you need to do depends on where you are.

You need to prove you’re legally allowed to get married by getting:

- a certificate of no impediment (CNI) and a statutory declaration if you’re in the UK
- a ‘Nulla Osta’ if you’re in Italy

If you’re not in the UK or Italy you’ll need to either:

- go to the UK and get a CNI
- go to Italy and get a Nulla Osta

^Your partner will also need a CNI and statutory declaration or a Nulla Osta if they’re British. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.^

### Get a CNI and a statutory declaration

You’ll need to get a CNI and a statutory declaration if you’re in the UK.

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.

^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)^

You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.

Your CNI won’t expire if it was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. CNIs issued in Scotland expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey.](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)

A CNI is valid for 6 months under Italian law.

You’ll also need to provide more information in a ‘statutory declaration’. You need to sign it in front of a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/) in the UK. They’ll charge you a fee.

There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

### Get a Nulla Osta

You’ll need to get a Nulla Osta if you’re in Italy.

To get a Nulla Osta, [make an appointment at the British Embassy in Rome](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-rome/notice-of-marriage-or-civil-partnership/slot_picker) to give notice of your marriage. Your partner doesn’t have to come with you.

You need to be in Italy for 3 full days before you can give notice. This means if you arrive on Monday you can’t give notice until Friday.

It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:receiving_notice_of_marriage) %> to give notice and <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:issuing_cni_or_nulla_osta) %> for the Nulla Osta. You can pay by card. If you want to pay in cash you need to pay in the [local currency](/government/publications/italy-consular-fees). 

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- a copy of your partner’s passport
- your [full birth certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) including your parents’ details
- [notice of marriage](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [affidavit for marriage](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) - you can fill in (but not sign) these in advance
- a residency certificate issued in the last 3 months (if you have one)
- proof that you’ve been in Italy for at least 3 full days (if you don’t have a residency certificate) - for example a boarding pass or a bank statement

^You can’t use an Italian address on your notice of marriage if you don’t have a residency certificate.^

If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll also need evidence that you or your former partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time of the divorce.^

The British embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 full days. This means if you give notice on Monday, it will be displayed until the following Tuesday. If nobody registers an objection, your Nulla Osta should be ready within 2 weeks of giving your notice. You can collect it in person or have it delivered by post.

You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is displayed.

### If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents doesn’t appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to provide evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). If you don’t, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

### Get your documents translated and legalised

If you’ve got a statutory declaration and CNI, you’ll need to get them [legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

You’ll also need to get a certified translation of your CNI. You need to use an [approved translator](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters).

You don’t need to get a Nulla Osta legalised or translated.

You need to get your supporting documents (for example, a decree absolute) [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) if they’re not in English or Italian.

You’ll be charged fees for translating your documents.

## Get married

You’ll need to give your Nulla Osta or CNI and statutory declaration to the person who’s going to marry you. This will be:

- a priest if you’re having a religious ceremony
- a registrar at the comune (town hall) if you’re having a civil ceremony

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Italy
- it would be allowed under UK law

You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the local comune. 

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
