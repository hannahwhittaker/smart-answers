Contact the relevant local authorities in Sweden to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You should also check the [travel advice for Sweden](/foreign-travel-advice/sweden).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Sweden.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-abroad/y/sweden/uk/partner_local/same_sex)
- [go to Sweden and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](https://www.gov.uk/marriage-abroad/y/sweden/ceremony_country/partner_local/same_sex)

%If you choose to post notice in Sweden, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%
