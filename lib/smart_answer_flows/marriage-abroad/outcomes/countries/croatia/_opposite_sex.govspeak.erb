Contact the relevant local authorities in Croatia to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need. This would be the registrar in the area where you want to get married.
^ You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Croatia](/foreign-travel-advice/croatia) before making any plans.

##What you need to do
You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re free to marry.
The local registrar may also need a certificate of custom law, which confirms that the marriage would be valid in the UK. This costs £50 from the [British Embassy in Zagreb](/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-croatia).  

##Prove you’re free to get married
You need to prove you’re legally allowed to get married by getting a:

- certificate of no impediment (CNI) 
- certificate of custom law - if the registrar has asked for it

If your partner is British they’ll need to apply for their own CNI and certificate of custom law.
You can get a CNI from your local register office in the UK or from the British Embassy in Zagreb.

###Get a CNI if you’re in the UK

You’ll need to get a CNI if you’re in the UK.

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.

Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland), [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages/), [Jersey](https://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).  

You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection. A CNI is valid for 3 months under Croatian law.

You can exchange your UK-issued CNI for one in Croatian and get a certificate of custom law (if you need to) from the [British Embassy in Croatia](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-zagreb/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

Download and fill in the section on certificate of custom and law in the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/croatia-marriage-pack) before your appointment. You’ll need to take your passport and UK-issued CNI to your appointment.

###Get a CNI from the embassy

You’ll need to have been living in Croatia for at least 3 full days before you can post notice. For example if you arrive on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

You can then book an appointment at the embassy to give notice of your marriage. It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:receiving_notice_of_marriage) %>. You can only pay by card.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Zagreb](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-zagreb/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

Download and fill in the [CNI application](/government/publications/croatia-marriage-pack) pack before your appointment.  It contains a list of the documents you’ll need.  Fill in the notice of marriage and affidavit for marriage in the application pack. Don’t sign it unless you’re posting it.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

You can also apply for marriage documents by post. 

The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll).
 
##What happens next

The consulate will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days.

The British embassy will then issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection).

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Croatia.

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI and certificate of custom law to the registrar or priest who’ll be marrying you.  

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Croatia
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You can’t register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate or an international marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the local registry office.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

You can pay by cash in the local currency or card.
