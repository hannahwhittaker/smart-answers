##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re free to register a civil partnership.

If your partner is British they’ll need to apply for their own CNI.

You can get a CNI from your local register office in the UK or from the British Embassy in Zagreb.

###Get a CNI if you’re in the UK

You’ll need to get a CNI if you’re in the UK.

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your civil partnership. A CNI costs £35.

Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland), [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages/), [Jersey](https://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).  

You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection. A CNI is valid for 3 months under Croatian law.

You can exchange your UK-issued CNI for one in Croatian and get a certificate of custom law (if you need to) from the [British Embassy in Croatia](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-zagreb/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

Download and fill in the section on certificate of custom and law in the [CNI application pack](/government/publications/croatia-civil-partnership-pack) before your appointment. You’ll need to take your passport and UK-issued CNI to your appointment.

###Get a CNI from the embassy

You’ll need to have been living in Croatia for at least 3 full days before you can post notice. For example if you arrive on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

You can then book an appointment at the embassy to give notice of your civil partnership. It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:receiving_notice_of_marriage) %>. You can only pay by card.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Zagreb](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-zagreb/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

You and your partner need to bring:

- your passport
- proof of residence such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need

You’ll need to complete and bring a [notice for civil partnership form and a civil partnership declaration form (an affirmation)](/government/publications/croatia-civil-partnership-pack).

Download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll).
 
##What happens next

The consulate will display your notice of civil partnership publicly for 7 full days.

The British embassy will then issue your CNI (as long as nobody has registered an objection) after 8 days. This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:issuing_cni_or_nulla_osta) %>. 

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Croatia.

You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.

You can pay by cash in the local currency or card.

##Your civil partnership ceremony

You’ll need to give your CNI to the registrar who’ll be conducting your civil partnership.

##After your civil partnership ceremony

Your civil partnership will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Croatia
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won’t need to register it in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your civil partnership certificate you can apply for them at the register office where the civil partnership took place.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
