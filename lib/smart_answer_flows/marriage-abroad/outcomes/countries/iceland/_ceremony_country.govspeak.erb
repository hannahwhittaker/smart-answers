##Before you start

You must contact the District Commissioner (‘Sýslumaðurinn’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need. Under Icelandic law District Commissioners make their own decisions about the documents needed.

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Iceland](/foreign-travel-advice/iceland) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

###Certificate of no impediment

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You need to be in Iceland for 3 full days before you can give notice. This means if you arrive on Monday you can’t give notice until Friday.

It costs £50 to give notice and £50 for the CNI. You can pay by credit card or in cash in Iceland and payment must be in the local currency.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Reykjavik to get a CNI](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-reykjavik/certificate-of-no-impediment/slot_picker).

You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- a copy of your partner’s passport
- [notice of marriage](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [affidavit or affirmation for marriage](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) - you can fill in (but don’t sign) in advance
- proof that you’ve been in Iceland for at least 3 full days (if you don’t live in Iceland) - for example a boarding pass or a hotel booking confirmation

###If you’ve been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll need to take one of the following documents:

- your original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF certified in the country where you got divorced) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your previous partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

You will need to take similar documents if your partner has been married or in a civil partnership before.

If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll also need evidence that you or your former partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.

If your document is not in English or Icelandic you’ll need to get it translated by a [private official translator](/government/publications/iceland-list-of-translators-and-interpreters). You’ll be charged for translating your documents.

You should check with the District Commissioner whether your [supporting documents need to be legalised](/get-document-legalised). A CNI issued by the British Embassy in Reykjavik does not normally need to be legalised.

###After you give notice

The British embassy will display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 full days. This means if you give notice on Monday, it will be displayed until the following Tuesday.

If nobody registers an objection, your CNI should be ready to collect from the embassy in Reykjavik within one week of giving your notice. You can also pay to have it sent to you by post or courier.

You don’t need to stay in the country while your notice is displayed.

Your CNI will usually be valid at the District Commissioner for 2 months.

###No trace letter

You may be asked to provide a ‘no trace letter’ by the District Commissioner. You can get a ‘no trace letter’ from the General Register Office. ‘No trace letters’ cost £50 for each 10 year period from age 16 or when you entered the UK. Specify how many years you need the search to cover and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’. It can take up to 3 weeks for a ‘no trace letter’ to be issued.

If you are from Scotland, you can get a ’to whom it may concern’ letter from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-abroad/what-documents-will-i-need-to-provide).

If you are from Northern Ireland, you can get a ‘certificate of legal capacity to marry’ or a ‘marriage index search’ from [nidirect](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/marriage-outside-uk).

Your partner will have to provide the same documents if they are a British national.

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI or no trace letter to the District Commissioner’s office.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Iceland
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the Registers Iceland (‘Þjóðskrá’), telephone +354 515 5300.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
