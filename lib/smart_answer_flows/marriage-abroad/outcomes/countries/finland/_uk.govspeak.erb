##Before you start

Contact the [relevant local authorities](http://www.maistraatti.fi/en/) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^ You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Finland](/foreign-travel-advice/finland) before making any plans.

##Prove you’re free to get married

You need to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove that you’re allowed to get married.

If your partner is British, they’ll need to follow the same process to get their own CNI. If they’re not British, the documents they need might be different.

###Get a CNI

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. It costs £35.

Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in
[Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern
Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of
Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry),
[Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or
[Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

You’ll need to take [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-to-take-to-the-register-office) with you to your appointment.

###After you give notice

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.

Your CNI is valid in Finland for 3 months.

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your CNI [legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).

You should also check with the local authority in Finland to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

###Name changes

You’ll need to provide evidence if the name on your documents is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). Your partner will also need to do
this if their name is different.

##Get married

You’ll need to take your CNI to the person who’s going to marry you.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

+ you follow the correct process according to the law in Finland
+ it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at the register
office or other venue where you got married.
